# Detect offensive and hateful speech in social media(Twitter).
Neural net to detect hate-speech and offensive language

# Approach 1:
- Uses LSTM with dropouts and layer normalization.

# Approach 2: (TODO)
- Use transformers (encoder only)

This project utilizes a set of hand annotated datasets provided by [@crowdflower](https://data.world/crowdflower).

***WARNING: The data, lexicons, and notebooks all contain content that is racist, sexist, homophobic, and offensive in many other ways.***
